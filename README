------------------

This is a set of simple utilites for deterministic transport, mostly
with a focus on reactor physics.  A lot of the code is taken from
things I've already done, adapted a bit, and put in one set of 
libraries for use via C++, Python, or (maybe) MATLAB.  There are
other similar projects out there (PyTRT is a very complete 
example), but, as is true for much development work, I needed my own tools 
for specific things.

Much of the capabilities are echoed in MATLAB for in MTP.

Features (to be) included:
  - Simple multigroup data container class
  - Cartesian mesh class
  - Quadrature for SN
  - SN sweeping routines 
  - Various solvers (SI, Krylov, etc.) for within-group and multigroup solves
