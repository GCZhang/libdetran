README - libdetran
------------------

Detran is a set of simple utilities for deterministic transport, mostly
with a focus on easy algorithm development for reactor physics.  Several
aspects of the design are directly inspired by ORNL code Denovo, especially
with respect to object orientation.  

Current features:
  - Multigroup diffusion, discrete ordinates, and method of 
    characteristics
  - Various built-in fixed source and eigenvalue solvers that can be extended
    via use of PETSc and SLEPc
  - Initial support for time-dependent transport with time varying sources
    and materials as well as support for arbitrary state-dependent materials
    for modeling feedback
  - Executable input via HDF5 or a somewhat limited text-based input
  - Full access via a SWIG-generated Python front end
  - Output to Silo for visualization in Visit or Paraview
